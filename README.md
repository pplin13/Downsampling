# Downsampling

To calculate the Theta- and Q- Criterion,
the examples using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes,
also with the additional jump term, can be found
in "Criteria.R".

To generate OU processes, also with the additional jump term,
Please see in "OU.R".

"NWEst.R" is to estimate the conditional moments of
order 1,2,4 and 6 using Nadaraya Watson Estimator.

The rest are the simulated or real-world data used in our analysis.
